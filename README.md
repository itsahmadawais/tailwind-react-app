#  Introduction ✋

This is a base project for creating a React.js app with Tailwind CSS. It includes the following libraries:

-   Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
-   React Router DOM: A library for handling client-side routing in React apps.
-   Folder Structure: A suggested folder structure for organizing your React components and files.
-   SCSS: A CSS Pr-compiler to make your life easy and helps you write CSS code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsahmadawais/tailwind-react-app.git
cd tailwind-react-app
npm install
```
## Usage 💻

To start the development server, run the following command:

`npm start` 

This will start the development server and open the app in your browser. You can now start building your React app!

## Folder Structure 📂

The project has the following file structure:

`your-project-name/`
`├── public/`
